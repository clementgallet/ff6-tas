1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,260
This is a Tool-Assisted Speedrun created by Kadmony and Keylie

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,660
The final time is 29:23.58, using 12114 rerecords

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,880
This is a 8661 frames (144 s) improvement over the previous TAS

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,720
You can visit tasvideos.org for more information

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,640
The ending is triggered the same way as the previous TAS

6
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,760
In short, arbitrary code is executed using a glitched weapon attack

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,720
This requires the Japanese version of the game, where an exclusive glitch allows you to equip any item

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,640
In this route, we need to attack with an X-Ether, found in the Ancient Castle

9
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:24,080
We access this place by combining the map id of the Cave to the Sealed Gate (0186) and the Phantom Train (0092)

10
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,640
This gives id 0192 which is the cave to the Ancient Castle

11
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,280
Battle Speed 6 (slowest), Message Speed 1 (fastest) and cursor on memory

12
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,840
We make one guard run away so that Terra gets just enough XP to reach level 4

13
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,720
The character levels for this fight are 4/2/3, which is lower than on the previous TAS (4/3/3)

14
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,200
So we need more manipulation of the damage variations to kill Whelk quickly

15
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,640
We make a first save here to store the event flags

16
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:19,360
We save inside Narshe to keep the uninitialized World Map coordinates in memory

17
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,040
We will be using these coordinates to teleport elsewhere in the World Map

18
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,680
We unequip both weapons, save and reset

19
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,480
We load the first save and overwrite the event flags of a newer save

20
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,240
We load again the other newer save and overwrite the party

21
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,360
We have build up a save outside Narshe with Terra/Locke party and events from the beginning of Narshe

22
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,040
This abnormal state allows us to freely enter Narshe

23
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,920
Lucky us, there are Sprint Shoes to sell in Narshe

24
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,240
We also need to sell both weapons for later

25
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,040
Now what happens if you reach the Narshe snowfield?

26
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,920
It sounds like you can trigger the Kefka at Narshe section!

27
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,080
Except Terra and Locke, all other characters are Moogles

28
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,960
We use a trick using a combination of menu and party switching to disable a battle trigger

29
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,760
Because of how underleveled we are, we will be using two desperation attacks

30
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,360
We can now choose our team and recruit Sabin and Cyan

31
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,160
We save here for a future warp

32
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,760
We transfer our team into an old Narshe savefile

33
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:44,240
Then we overwrite the World Map coords to uninitialized ones, because we didn't leave Narshe in this savefile

34
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,880
We manipulated these uninitialized values to be close to the Cave to the Sealed Gate

35
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,160
We cannot get past the camp in front of the cave, so we use X coord overwriting

36
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,240
We make a detour by Doma Castle to register specific party coordinates in memory

37
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,400
This will later get us inbounds when warping to the cave before Ancient Castle

38
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,640
More X coord overwriting to reach the Cave to the Sealed Gate

39
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,320
We previously set the Message Speed to 2, so that we can escape certain fights like this one much quicker

40
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:51,520
There is a general rule: if you have more characters than enemies, only some of your party will escape quickly in preemptive fights

41
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,440
The rest of your party will escape 2 seconds later

42
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,200
By setting the Message Speed to a higher value, the game has enough time to make the whole party escape

43
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,840
We save the map id in a slot file, and load the previous one

44
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,520
There is a little shortcut to access the Phantom Train, by entering the forest from the south

45
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,360
We recruit a Ghost because he has an insta-kill attack

46
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,680
We overwrite only one byte of the map id

47
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,520
Grabbing the X-Ether

48
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,080
It is faster the scroll an item down during a fight than in the menu

49
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,840
Equipping the X-Ether using the Optimize glitch

50
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,040
Writing the code that triggers the ending using colors

51
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:46,320
This part has been optimized compared to the previous TAS by carefully choosing the right offset to minimize color changes (-7 sec)

52
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,000
The Goblin enemy has a special script when alone, so we kill one quickly with the Ghost

53
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,440
We buffer some long animations to delay the action of the other enemy

54
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,240
We need the Goblin to cast Muddle on Locke, so that he attacks with the glitched weapon

55
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,080
This must occur at a specific frame, after about 5 minutes of fight

56
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,040
We manipulate the chain of attacks of the enemy so that he call Muddle as late as possible while not killing Locke

57
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,760
Our custom code that will be executed consists on:

58
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,080
1. Store the ending address in the event pointer

59
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,680
2. Set a flag to remove the ending softlock

60
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:50,240
This softlock happens when you trigger the ending without entering the World of Ruin

61
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,560
3. Fix the stack that has been corrupted by the glitch

62
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,000
4. Remove all enemies from the fight. It triggers the end of the fight

63
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,240
5. Remove the Death flag from the dead enemy

64
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,000
Otherwise we get XP/Gold messages that we would have to confirm manually

65
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,600
6. Return to the normal code execution

66
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,440
End of inputs!
