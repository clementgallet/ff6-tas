This document contains a list of all the event bits in the game, with the
exception of activation flags for non-playable characters; for completeness
and contiguity, information on the battle event bits has been included in this
writing. An event bit, in essence, provides information indicating whether a
requirement of a conditional-branch instruction has been satisfied. Put
succinctly, it acts as a switch.

Interestingly, there are approximately 140 unused event bits, which can be
incorporated into hacking projects. One should nevertheless be cautious about
the bits labelled as such. Since neither the event code nor the assembly code
has ever been portrayed as accurately as can be, it is practically impossible
to ascertain which bits are really unused, hence the regular inclusion of a
question mark in the list.

Please note that certain functions involving an event bit are not executed on
the world map. For instance, a bit that is supposed to be cleared on each step
taken by a party will not be cleared on such a map; likewise, the bit that
disables menu access will have no effect. Further note that the event bits are
stored in 96 bytes of RAM from address $1E80 to $1EDF in bank $7E.

I recommend that this document be used in conjunction with an event dump
produced from Yousei's Event Disassembler, as they complement each other
nicely. The most recent disassembly can be found on the site of Imzogelmo:

                               ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
###############################################################################

Yousei deserves the utmost credit for writing the Event Disassembler, which
provided the basis for this study. A good share of the credit goes to those,
myself included, who have contributed to Yousei's program over the years.

Thanks to Imzogelmo for his documents on event triggers, map event pointers,
and non-playable characters, as they accelerated the process and reduced the
risk of errors. I also want to say a word of thanks for the occasional feedback
during the preliminary phase.

My acknowledgements to Nhat for proofreading some of the descriptions.

Thanks to Geiger for his wonderful Snes9X debugger. Without a tool of that
nature and caliber, it would have been fairly difficult to compile such a list.

Lastly, I would like to thank everyone who dedicated themselves to generating
or supplementing a commented disassembly of one of the many banks in the game.
