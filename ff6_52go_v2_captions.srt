00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,920
This is a Tool-Assisted Speedrun created by エディ, kadmony, keylie and pirohiko

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,580
The final time is 24:33.26, using 23592 rerecords

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,060
This TAS uses the 52 gameover glitch to trigger the ending

4
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,960
This glitch has been documented in a previous submission on tasvideos.org website

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,440
In short, after dying 52 times in the world map, the game loads a corrupted value of the event pointer

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:55,560
By manipulated this value, we can execute script code from RAM, and trigger the ending

7
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,840
Message Speed to 1, Cursor to Memory, remove all equipment from Terra

8
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,000
We need Terra to die without loosing much time

9
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,040
The best fight to do that is this Pincer attack

10
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,380
We need one soldier to escape so the other one reaches level 3

11
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,620
This is mandatory for the quick Whelk fight

12
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,200
Terra level 4, Vicks level 2, Wedge level 3

13
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,300
This is a new trick: casting Def. with Terra speeds up the escape by 4 seconds

14
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:40,080
We need to walk extra steps at some point. Doing it here speeds up the ATB manipulation

15
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,340
Thanks to Battle Speed is 3, Whelk shell will take two turns before hiding

16
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,660
This allows Whelk head to fight twice

17
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,600
We need Terra to die in this fight, but she needs to do two attacks before being killed

18
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,920
We also must manipulate each attack to be of high damage in the value range

19
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,080
We setup the inventory for later

20
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,540
slot 2: Leather Hat, slot 4: Buckler, slots 0/1/3: empty

21
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,260
Terra is renamed "TE" to manipulate a savefile checksum later

22
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,400
We are going to escape Narshe through this door

23
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:34,040
There is currently a NPC blocking this door, but we will use the first savefile to overwrite it

24
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,080
We first need to reach the save point

25
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,920
It is crucial to trigger a fight next to the save point (hence the extra steps)

26
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,820
Slot 3 is our backup, slot 2 is the one we will work on

27
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,000
First, we overwrite the savefile until NPC addresses, and reset

28
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,260
We now have the Terra/Vicks/Wedge party, but we want the solo Terra party

29
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,380
So we overwrite the party addresses in slot 2 with the solo Terra party

30
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,360
At last, we need a dead Terra

31
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,060
So we load the first slot, and we overwrite the Terra status addresses

32
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,420
Thanks to the Terra renaming, the checksum of the second savefile is correct!

33
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,760
Because the party is dead, we must not have a fight in this area

34
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,600
This is why we saved just after a fight

35
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,820
Our inventory is nearly complete, we only need the Mithril Pike

36
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,900
In the previous TAS we got it from Mog

37
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,780
Fortunately, we can buy it in Narshe!

38
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,220
We also need the hex value of our money to end with C4

39
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,500
The easiest value to reach is 452 (1C4)

40
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,060
We just have to buy 4 Mithril Pike and sell 1 Sleeping Bag

41
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,520
We are almost ready, we need to save outside just before a fight

42
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,540
And inputting the code to trigger the ending using menu colors

43
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,360
Thanks to Eddie, there is a faster way to start the 52 gameovers

44
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,680
If you die against the monster-in-a-box fight, it will count as 3 fights

45
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,500
And now starts the remaining fights...

46
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,520
Having a dead party saves about 2 minutes

47
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,920
You can skip to 24min for the last fights
